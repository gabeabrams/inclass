## Server Tests

```
npm tests
```

## Integration and UI Tests

Run the following in different terminal tabs:

```
npm run dev:canvas
npm run dev:server-installable
npm run dev:client
```

Run the tests

```
npm run selenium
```

## Client UI Component Tests

```
npm run test-client
```

If tests do not run, this may be because no testable changes have occurred since the last commit. If so, just hit "a" on your keyboard (see instructions in terminal).
