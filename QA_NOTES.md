# Manual QA: App Store

## Sign into Canvas and Launch App Store

1. Log into Canvas with your Harvard Key: [canvas.harvard.edu](https://www.pin1.harvard.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fcanvas.harvard.edu%2Flogin%2Fcas)
2. Select a Canvas course that has App Store (stage) installed. A course that has this app installed as of March 2020 is “Gabe’s 'Sandbox'-- DCE.” If you need access to this or another course for test purposes, request access from Gabe Abrams. 
3. Click on App Store (stage) in the sidebar to launch the app; when prompted, click 'Authorize.' EXPECT: The app loads and the user is directed to the App Store home page. 

## Check App Overview
1. On the App Store home page, click the first app in the list. EXPECT: A new page loads with an overview of the app. There are two tabs: 'Screenshots' and 'Info'.
2. Check the 'Screenshots' tab. EXPECT: It contains one or more screenshots pertaining to the app. The screenshots display clearly and are formatted in a way that fits the page and are easy for the user to view.
3. Check the 'Info' tab. EXPECT: It contains additional information about the app. This could include a short description, and information about availability and placement of the app. EXPECT: The information is free of typographical and grammatical errors.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 with each remaining app. 

## Install and Uninstall Apps
1. On the App Store home page, click the first app in the list. EXPECT: A new page loads with an overview of the app. There are two buttons in the lower right corner: one is labeled either 'Install' or 'Uninstall', the other is labeled 'Get Support'.
2. Ensure the app is ready to be installed. If the button is labeled 'Install', go to step 3. If the button is labeled 'Uninstall': click the button. EXPECT: A popup message appears informing you that the app has been uninstalled.
	- Verify the app was uninstalled in Canvas. Refresh the Canvas course home page. EXPECT: The app that was just uninstalled does not appear in its specified location (e.g. the side nav bar, as an external tool in 'Assignments', etc.)
3. Click the 'Install' button. Depending on the app, the expected behavior may be of type A or B.
	- EXPECT A: A popup message appears informing the user that the app has been installed. The formatting of the popup message looks good.
	- EXPECT B: A popup window appears with a message that the app must be requested via email. EXPECT: The window includes a 'Send to' and a 'Subject' field: the 'Send to' field is populated with an email address, and the 'Subject' field is populated with a relevant message containing the course ID. The formatting of the popup window looks good.
4. Click either the 'Close' button or the 'X' in the top right corner of popup window. EXPECT: The user's action closes the popup window, and the user remains on the app overview page. 
5. If the popup message stated that the app was installed, verify the installation in Canvas. In the Canvas course, locate the app that was just installed. EXPECT: The app appears in its specified location (e.g. the side nav bar, as an external tool in 'Assignments', etc.) 
6. Repeat steps 1-5 with each remaining app. 

## Check the 'Get Support' Button
1. On the App Store home page, click the first app in the list. EXPECT: A new page loads with an overview of the app. There are two buttons in the lower right corner: one is labeled either 'Install' or 'Uninstall', the other is labeled 'Get Support'.
2. Click the 'Get Support' button. EXPECT: A popup window appears with information to send a support request. The window includes a 'Send to' and a 'Subject' field: the 'Send to' field is populated with an email address, and the 'Subject' field is populated with a relevant message containing the course ID. The formatting of the popup window looks good.
3. Click either the 'Close' button or the 'X' in the top right corner of popup window. EXPECT: The user's action closes the popup window, and the user remains on the app overview page.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 with each remaining app. 

## Check 'Filters & Tags'
1. On the App Store home page, click the 'Filters & Tags' link near the top of the page. EXPECT: A dropdown menu appears, containing a series of boxes. EXPECT: Each box represents a different filter (e.g 'Type', 'Location') and contains a list of tags formatted as checkboxes.
2. Choose a filter, e.g. 'Type'. For that filter, select the checkbox for one of the tags. EXPECT: The apps will be filtered according to the tag that was selected. For example, if 'Grading' is the selected tag, only those apps that pertain to grading will appear in the list of apps.
3. Select more than one tag within the same filter. EXPECT: The apps will be filtered according to the tags that were selected. 
4. Select tags from more than one filter. EXPECT: Apps will be filtered according to both the filters and tags that were selected.
5. Click the 'Reset' button for one of the filters. EXPECT: Any checkboxes that were selected within that filter are now unselected.
6. Click the 'Filters & Tags' link again. EXPECT: The dropdown menu is hidden from view. 

## Test the 'Search' box
1. On the App Store home page, type 'swipein' into the 'Search' box, located near the top of the page. EXPECT: The search filters and returns the app 'SwipeIn' from the list of apps; no other apps are displayed.
